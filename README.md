# backtrack-sudoku

Sudoku solver using the backtrack algorithm

## The project

An app that allows the user to try their hand at solving a range of sudoku puzzles of various sizes and difficulties.

It incorporates a built-in solver that rapidly solves puzzles of any size using the backtrack algorithm.

The user can try to solve the puzzle and check their solution, or simply ask the app to solve the puzzle itself. They can also watch a playthrough of the backtrack algorithm in action, at different speeds, serving as a learning tool.

The project is built on the Model-View-Controller software design pattern, more information can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller


## Important scripts

`solve_sudoku.py` contains all the functions necessary to solve a given board.

`solve_sudoku_recursive.py` is a newer and faster backtrack algorithm that uses recursion.

`sudoku_gui.py` contains all the code necessary to produce the GUI.

`main.py` is the controller that connects the model (solver) and the view (GUI).

There are programs to test both algorithms on 3x3, 4x4, 6x6 and 9x9 boards, but can generalise to solve any size board.
